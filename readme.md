**Description**

Who doesn't love games? Throughout week four of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive we have focused on creating a game with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  I chose to make a Paintball trivia game. Have you been itching to increase your trivial knowledge for that next Wednesday night pub event? You've come to the right place.

**Example** 

Paintball Trivia runs smoothly and directs the user via clickable prompts througout the experince.

Don't worry, if you answer correctly the game will congratulate you AND award points!

Every so often ghost lines will appear.

The lines appear in the same locations and seem driven by mouse placement, but not a "mouse over" event.  Any ideas?
