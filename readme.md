**Description**

Who doesn't love games? Throughout week four of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive we have focused on creating a game with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  I chose to make a Paintball trivia game. Have you been itching to increase your trivial knowledge for that next Wednesday night pub event? You've come to the right place.

**Example** 

Paintball Trivia runs smoothly and directs the user via clickable prompts througout the experince.

Don't worry, if you answer correctly the game will congratulate you AND award points!

**Getting Started**

First I sat down with pen and paper to plan out the ensuing process.  I needed a basic playing field to create and test the logic that would eventually drive the game.  I used grid as a base and flex-box to polish off the process of layout deisgn.  After creating a question/answer bank, I used Javascript to track right or wrong answers and move foward throughout gameplay.  Once I ironed out those wrinkles I used CSS to make the game more pleasing to the eye.  

**Technology**      
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Sublime Text

Every so often ghost lines will appear.

The lines appear in the same locations and seem driven by mouse placement, but not a "mouse over" event.  Any ideas?
